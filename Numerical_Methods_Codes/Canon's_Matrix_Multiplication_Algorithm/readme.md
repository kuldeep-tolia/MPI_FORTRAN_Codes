Problem Description:  

-> This is a MPI program for multiplication of two square matrices of size $N \times N$ using Canon's algorithm.  
-> The block-decomposition is performed in both directions and each block is shifted accordingly to compute the global values.    
-> The restriction for this program is that the number of processes used should be a square number.
