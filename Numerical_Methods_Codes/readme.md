-> This section has computer programs that implements solution procedures for solving linear and non-linear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations (ODE), partial differential equations (PDE), and matrix-multiplication.    
-> Finite Difference Method (FDM) forms the basis of the discretization of the governing equations.  
-> The programs are parallelized using MPI and the speedup performance of the parallelized codes is measured.  
-> To check the syntax/operation of a particular MPI call, you may refer to the following websites which provides description of each clause/construct:
- https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v3.1/  
- https://rookiehpc.org/mpi/docs/index.html  

-> I have used mpifortran wrapper to compile and link my MPI programs.  
-> Compiling and running a FORTRAN program:
- $ mpifortran file_name.f90 -o ./output_name.out
- $ mpirun -np <num_process> ./output_name.out
